## Areas of Opportunity

I struggled mostly with positioning. I like to believe I have strong styling skills, in terms of being able to generate color schemes, create borders, etc., but struggle with positioning, especially when trying to create a responsive page. Javascript was not used as I am still at a very base level knowledge of Javascript, but I believe it may have actually been a more helpful idea to use for responsive positioning. As I am focused more on broad styling, I did not bother with the background pattern images, but if I am not mistaken the two within the hero section would be positioned absolutely with overflow hidden.
